Installation
------------

* Download and extract the files on your Zabbix server, somewhere web-accessible. It is possible to host this dashboard on an external server, but some work is required to do so. This will be outlined in the wiki.

* Edit index.html and change the line `var zabbix = new $.zabbix ('http://zabbix.org/zabbix/api_jsonrpc.php', 'guest', '');` as follows:

  Change http://zabbix.org to the IP or DNS name of your Zabbix server (but leave the `/zabbix/api_jsonrpc.php`)

  Change `guest` and the empty string to the username and password (respectively) of a Zabbix user that the GUI will use to access the data. Ideally this should be a Zabbix user with Read-only access to the Host Groups you want to show. **Don't use your own user!** We make no effort to hide the password...

* You may have to add an item for each of these keys to your host Templates:

    `system.cpu.num` - set as decimal

    `system.cpu.load` - set as float

    `vm.memory.size[total]` - set as decimal

    `vm.memory.size[free]` - set as decimal

    `vm.memory.size[cached]` - set as decimal

    `vm.memory.size[inactive]` - set as decimal
